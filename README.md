# MSCS632Assignment7

1 Overview

You will implement a program that calculates basic statistics (mean, median, and mode) on a list of integers. The program will be implemented in C, OCaml, and Python, demonstrating a different paradigm in each language.

2 Problem Requirements

The Ride Sharing System must include the following components at a minimum. You should add additional functionality and feel free to be creative.

    1. Problem: Given a list of integers, calculate the following statistics:
    Mean: The average of all integers in the list.
    Median: The middle value of the list when sorted.
    Mode: The most frequently occurring integer(s) in the list.
    2. Languages and Paradigms:
    C: Implement using a procedural approach.
    OCaml: Implement using a functional approach.
    Python: Implement using an object-oriented approach.

3 Implementation Details

    1. C (Procedural)
    Define the program in a single file with functions for calculat- ing mean, median, and mode.
    Use an array to store integers and implement sorting and counting logic directly.
    Focus on managing memory manually, as C lacks built-in garbage collection.
    2. OCaml (Functional)
    Implement the program with a focus on immutable data and higher-order functions.
    Use list operations such as map, fold, or filter to calculate mean, median, and mode.
    Avoid mutable state by using OCaml’s functional constructs.
    3. Python (Object-Oriented)
    Create a StatisticsCalculator class with methods for calculat- ing mean, median, and mode.
    Use Python’s list and dictionary data structures to store and manipulate data.
    Ensure each statistic calculation is encapsulated in a method within the class, demonstrating OOP principles.

4 Deliverable

    1. Code Implementation:
    Submit working code in each language (C, OCaml, and Python) for mean, median, and mode calculations. Your code should be stored in a GitHub repo for this assignment. Add the link to the repo in your report.
    2. Documentation:
    A brief report, 1 page, comparing the experience of implement- ing the solution in each paradigm. Discuss any challenges and key differences observed between the procedural, functional, and object-oriented approaches.
    Report should follow APA 7 guidelines.
    3. Sample Output:
    Provide screenshots of your code and sample output showing system usage in both languages.
    The screenshots should be appended to your report.

Submit one document (.docx or pdf) that includes your report, GitHub link, and your screenshots.
